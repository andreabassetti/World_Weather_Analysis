# World_Weather_Analysis

## Overview:
The purpose of this project is help build an app called PlanMyTrip. The owners of the app recommended a few changes to take the app to the next level. Specifically, they recommend adding the weather description to the weather, filters for the users weather preferences, and the ability to choose four cities to create a travel itinerary. Finally, using the Google Maps Directions API, the app will create a travel route between the four cities as well as a marker layer map.
